This is an XKB/XCompose based input method for Anishinabemowin syllabics.
It will work with anything that uses XIM (most programs if given the proper enviornment variables).

The layout here is the same as Chris Harvey's Anishininimowin Right Dot keyboard available at
http://languagegeek.com/algon/syllabics_keyboards/cr_oj_oc_na.html


TO INSTALL
----------

``` bash
sudo cp nish /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/
cp XCompose ~/.XCompose
```

If you already have a .XCompose file, add everything after the first line to your current one.
To use this layout you need to set the enviornment variable

    GTK_IM_MODULE="xim"

and run the command

    setxkbmap "us,nish" -option "compose:menu,grp:caps_toggle"

Caps Lock will now switch between latin (US with compose key here, but can be changed) and syllabics.
